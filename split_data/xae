550430280725446656  Dec 31 17:16  @MeanStreetsOMA  No matter what, it is not worth wrecking your car and hurting yourself or someone else, or getting a DUI. But, some folks inevitably will.
550430636306350082  Dec 31 17:17  @MeanStreetsOMA  So, the Police and Fire Department will be around to enforce laws, transport victims, and clean up after the mess. Have fun tonight Omaha!
