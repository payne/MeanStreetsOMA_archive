532660483703468033  Nov 12 16:25  @MeanStreetsOMA  Lots of rumors still about Mon-Tuesday's wintry-mix. It's clear the City, County, State & drivers were caught off guard. Editing audio now.
532660900369821696  Nov 12 16:27  @MeanStreetsOMA  The first request for salt/sand trucks was 11:46 PM Monday evening, only after numerous wrecks at I-80/680 interchange.
532661639087398912  Nov 12 16:30  @MeanStreetsOMA  The first clearly weather-related wreck Monday evening was at 11:17 PM at 168th and Dodge, where an SUV hit the median.
532662331009167360  Nov 12 16:32  @MeanStreetsOMA  Slick roads started after 11:00 PM on untreated City, County, and State Roads Department jurisdictions. No one had treated any roads.
532662999446986752  Nov 12 16:35  @MeanStreetsOMA  First trouble spots Monday evening were Interstates/Freeways: I-80/680, West Dodge Rd, JFK Freeway, I-80/42nd. All State Roads Dept areas.
532664584084398080  Nov 12 16:41  @MeanStreetsOMA  Another trouble spot was Hwy 275 and Maple Street area, which is Doug County Roads. Described as "a sheet of ice" after a truck hit a pole.
532665170804637696  Nov 12 16:44  @MeanStreetsOMA  @Meg_onthe_News Working on it, it's going to be a while. Just got to Midnight!
532665745067757568  Nov 12 16:46  @MeanStreetsOMA  At 12:02 AM Tuesday NDOR was requested to salt/sand the Hwy 275/Waterloo area "at their earliest convenience".
532670002093391872  Nov 12 17:03  @MeanStreetsOMA  At 12:23 AM Tuesday morning NDOR gave OPD a 45 minute ETA on sand/salt trucks being able to hit the Interstate system.
532670618765099008  Nov 12 17:05  @MeanStreetsOMA  At 12:26 AM Tuesday morning US75/North Freeway at about Pratt was described as a "sheet of ice", NODR requested to salt/sand.
532671236909043712  Nov 12 17:08  @MeanStreetsOMA  At 12:30 AM a semi tanker truck carrying fuel jackknifed at I-80 eastbound at L street, completely blocking all Interstate traffic.
532671566229037057  Nov 12 17:09  @MeanStreetsOMA  @JenJoy Keep in mind @Jean_Stothert and the City of Omaha have no jurisdiction over the Interstate system in Omaha, NDOR does.
532672297724047361  Nov 12 17:12  @MeanStreetsOMA  It is important to note that the City of Omaha is not responsible for salt/sanding the Interstate or State highways in Omaha.
532675095337390081  Nov 12 17:23  @MeanStreetsOMA  @RickySmith Clearly no one was prepared for this type of ice storm happening at this time.
532680181828575232  Nov 12 17:43  @MeanStreetsOMA  Here is part one of Omaha's Monday-Tuesday First Wintry Mix, from about 11:13 PM-12:30 AM. http://t.co/q57XQow24N
532684379852918787  Nov 12 18:00  @MeanStreetsOMA  Continuing my analysis of the Mon-Tues Wintry Mix, the semi that jackknifed at I80 EB at L Street was in a very bad spot, construction zone.
532684717498576897  Nov 12 18:01  @MeanStreetsOMA  Semi was wedged between the permanent center concrete median and the temporary construction "jersey barriers". Access to area very limited.
532686056966336513  Nov 12 18:07  @MeanStreetsOMA  In order for tow trucks to straighten the semi, jersey barriers needed to be moved: Pic via @OPD_Lt_Swanson: http://t.co/Oye0dBrVF2
532690832990928896  Nov 12 18:26  @MeanStreetsOMA  At about 1:10 AM Tues contracted workers were in the area who had equipment to move the barriers, but wouldn't without bosses approval.

532693434797395968  Nov 12 18:36  @MeanStreetsOMA  After another 45 minutes of 3rd-4th hand communications, NDOR finally got a crew with a skid-steer to the semi scene to remove barriers.
